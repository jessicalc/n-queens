// board = 5x5
// initialize with a solution counter
// 1) find a spot that's 0. put a 1 there. 
// 1a)  increase the queen counter++
// 2) set the rest of the values in the 0 row to X.
// 3) set the rest of the values in the 0 column to X. 
// 4) set the rest of the right-diagonal squares to X
// 5) set the rest of the left diagonal squares to X.
// 6) find the next available spot that's 0 (repeat steps 1-5)
// 7) check if queen counter === n then we can exit and solution++, then go to the next cell


// at the end, replace all X with 0s
